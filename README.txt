This project is designed by Emre Halac to practice HTML+CSS+JavaScript basics that I learned by myself + at my college. 
(Because practice makes perfect ! :) )

The project is a basic calculator that can calculate + - * / repeteadly. It also makes exponential calculations by clicking **(twice). 
I also cared about  basic but responsive design so that people can work on with different devices such as mobile phones or tablets
as well as computers.

It also allows to get values either with numpad or with 
buttons.
